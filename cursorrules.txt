## Problem Statement
Application had poor text contrast with light gray text on white/light backgrounds, making content difficult to read for users.

## Root Causes
Inconsistent text color classes, overuse of light Tailwind grays, lack of standardized color tokens, and no contrast checking during development.

## Rules for Maintaining High Contrast

1. **Use black text for headings, dark text (minimum gray-800) for all content, and appropriate contrast for tables, forms, and interactive elements.

2. **Apply custom high-contrast utility classes and regularly test using contrast checking tools to maintain a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio.
